WiLBiT is a front-end framework used for C#.NET, VB.NET, (and maybe) C++.NET. Back-end code may apply. It is currently in **early development**, meaning features will be very few. It's only the beginning, however updates will be added frequently to this framework.

Currently, it supports **multiple controls**, with all of them having automatic **real transparency**, meaning it won't just have the Transparent color, it will actually have the element of Transparency, you'll be able to see what's behind a control.

If you look below on the preview, you'll see the **100% Transparency** texts. Usually, they would be covered with the **color of the button parent (e.g. Panel/Form color)**, but with WiLBiT, we don't let it slide!

Scroll down to see a visual **Transparency example**.

WiLBiT is also **optimized for good performance**. What does that mean? When opening/using an application that operates with the WiLBiT Framework, app performance should not be an issue.

We also have a **very smooth** and **customizable** animations engine. Here's a preview:

We ALSO have a **powerful obfuscator** which is going to be available in the **WiLBiT Framework.exe** once WiLBiT gets released. With WiLBiT's Application, you'll be able to Install WiLBiT, Export it, Obfuscate apps made with WiLBiT, Check out updates, Contribute with the community, and more. Soon, you'll be able to use **Paid Versions** of WiLBiT after we add our Account System. Yes, there will be paid subscriptions soon, however you'll still be able to use **WiLBiT for Personal, Commercial use**.

Want to check out how powerful our obfuscator is? Check out the image below. Some decompilers can't even decompile the protected code.
