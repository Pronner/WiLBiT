WiLBiT is a front-end framework used for C#.NET, VB.NET, (and maybe) C++.NET. Back-end code may apply. It is currently in **early development**, meaning features will be very few. It's only the beginning, however updates will be added frequently to this framework.

### Support
- [x] C#.NET (100%)
- [x] VB.NET (100%)
- [x] C++.NET (50%)

— 100% : Fully supported, should have no irregular bugs.\
— 50% : Not completely supported, but should function.

### Early development

Not many features, not many updates. It's just me working on this, so I won't be able to work on it very quickly.

## Licensing
No license? No rights.\
You're only allowed to use the **distributed DLLs** from WiLBiT via **NuGET** or our [**Releases page**](https://github.com/Pronner/WiLBiT/releases), and if you use them immorally, you know what may be coming.
