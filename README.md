WiLBiT is a front-end framework used for C#.NET, VB.NET, (and maybe) C++.NET. Back-end code may apply. It is currently in **early development**, meaning features will be very few. It's only the beginning, however updates will be added frequently to this framework.

Currently, it supports **multiple controls**, with all of them having automatic **real transparency**, meaning it won't just have the Transparent color, it will actually have the element of Transparency, you'll be able to see what's behind a control.

If you look below on the preview, you'll see the **100% Transparency** texts. Usually, they would be covered with the **color of the button parent (e.g. Panel/Form color)**, but with WiLBiT, we don't let it slide!

Scroll down to see a visual **Transparency example**.

WiLBiT is also **optimized for good performance**. What does that mean? When opening/using an application that operates with the WiLBiT Framework, app performance should not be an issue.

We also have a **very smooth** and **customizable** animations engine. Here's a preview:

### Support
- [x] C#.NET (100%)
- [x] VB.NET (100%)
- [x] C++.NET (50%)

-> 100% : Fully supported, should have no irregular bugs.\
-> 50% : Not completely supported, but should function.

### Early development

Not many features, not many updates. It's just me working on this, so I won't be able to work on it very quickly.
