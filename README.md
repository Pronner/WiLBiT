WiLBiT is a front-end framework used for C#.NET, VB.NET, (and maybe) C++.NET. Back-end code may apply. It is currently in **early development**, meaning features will be very few. It's only the beginning, however updates will be added frequently to this framework.

Currently, it supports **multiple controls**, with all of them having automatic **real transparency**, meaning it won't just have the Transparent color, it will actually have the element of Transparency. You'll be able to see what's behind a control.

If you look below on the preview, you'll see the **100% Transparency** texts. Usually, they would be covered with the **color of the button parent (e.g. Panel/Form color)**, but with WiLBiT, we don't let it slide!

### Transparency example

WiLBiT is also **optimized for good performance, good UI loading**. What does that mean? When opening/using an application that operates with the WiLBiT Framework, performance should not be an issue, neither should UI loading. Developers won't have to unnecessarily add code just for optimization of the controls.

### Support
- [x] C#.NET (100%)
- [x] VB.NET (100%)
- [x] C++.NET (50%)

-> 100% : Fully supported, should have no irregular bugs.\
-> 50% : Not completely supported, but should function.

### Early development

Not many features, not many updates. It's just me working on this, so I won't be able to work on it very quickly.

## Licensing
No license? No rights.\
You're only allowed to use the **distributed DLLs** from WiLBiT via **NuGET** or our [**Releases page**](https://github.com/Pronner/WiLBiT/releases), and if you use them immorally, you know what may be coming.
